## What is Nerve Calm?

So, what exactly are we looking at? **Nerve Calm** is a dietary supplement that comes in capsule form. It’s designed to target those frustrating nerve symptoms head-on, using a blend of vitamins and plant-based ingredients.  

The idea is to nourish your nervous system back to health rather than just masking the pain.

### Who is the manufacturer?  
Nerve Calm is made by a U.S.-based company that specialises in natural health formulas. They’re pretty tight-lipped about the specific team behind it, which isn't uncommon but worth noting.  

The important part? They claim to manufacture in the U.S. under **FDA guidelines** and **Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).**

### How does it claim to work?  
The claim isn't about an overnight miracle. Instead, the philosophy is about filling in the nutritional gaps. Modern diets often lack key nutrients crucial for nerve repair and function.  

Nerve Calm claims to deliver these compounds, aiming to:  
- Soothe irritated nerves  
- Support the repair of their protective coating  
- Calm inflammatory responses  

### Key features of the supplement  
- Non-habit forming  
- Made from natural ingredients  
- Free of stimulants (won’t disrupt sleep)
